-> Flight Delay Analysis Dashboard

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of flight delays across major U.S. airports using an interactive Tableau dashboard. It utilizes a publicly available dataset to identify patterns, explore root causes of delays, and provide actionable insights.

-> Project Overview
The goal of this project is to visualize flight delay data in a meaningful way to answer key questions such as:

- Which airports experience the most delays?
- During which months are delays more frequent?
- What are the most common causes of delays (e.g., weather, carrier, security)?
- The dashboard is designed to allow users to interactively filter and explore delay trends based on various dimensions such as time, airport, and delay cause.

-> Dataset
Source: Kaggle â€“ Flight Delay and Causes Dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/undersc0re/flight-delay-and-causes)
The dataset contains detailed information on flight delays in the United States, including delay durations and contributing factors such as weather conditions, air traffic (NAS), and airline operations.
Note: All rights to the dataset belong to the original creator. This project uses the dataset for academic and analysis purposes only.

-> Files Included
Flight_Delay_Analysis.twbx: Tableau workbook file containing the dashboard.
flight_delay_causes.csv: The cleaned dataset used in the analysis.
README.md: Project documentation.

-> Tools Used
Tableau Public: For building interactive visualizations and dashboards.
Microsoft Excel / CSV: For data preprocessing.
Kaggle: Dataset source.

-> Key Findings
Carrier-related issues are the most frequent cause of delays.
Delays peak during certain months due to seasonal factors.
Certain airports consistently report higher delay frequencies.

-> How to Use
Clone or download this repository.
Open the .twbx file in Tableau Public or Tableau Desktop.
Use the dashboard controls to explore delay patterns across airports and time periods.
